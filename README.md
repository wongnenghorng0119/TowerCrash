## 🎮 Game Mechanics Deep Dive

### 🎲 Provably Fair Randomness

Our game uses Sui's built-in randomness for fair NFT generation:

```move
// Pseudocode for random generation
let random_value = object::uid_to_bytes(&tower.id);
let rarity = calculate_rarity(random_value);
let stats = generate_stats(rarity, random_value);
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ On-chain randomness using object UID
- ✅ Transparent and verifiable
- ✅ Cannot be manipulated or predicted
- ✅ Fair distribution across all players

### ⚔️ Combat System

**Tower Mechanics**
- 🎯 **Auto-targeting**: Towers automatically target nearest monster
- 💥 **Damage Calculation**: Base damage × rarity multiplier
- 📏 **Range Check**: Monsters must be within tower range
- ⏱️ **Fire Rate**: Cooldown between attacks

**Monster Behavior**
- 🛣️ **Pathfinding**: Follow predefined path to base
- 💨 **Speed Variation**: Different types move at different speeds
- ❤️ **Health System**: Take damage until HP reaches 0
- 🎯 **Wave Spawning**: Timed spawns with increasing difficulty

### 📊 Stat Calculation Formula

```javascript
// Rarity Multipliers
Common:    1.0x base stats
Rare:      1.5x base stats
Epic:      2.5x base stats
Legendary: 4.0x base stats

// Example: Legendary Tower
Damage:    15-23 base → 60-92 actual
Range:     100-120 base → 400-480 actual
Fire Rate: 700-1000ms (lower is better)
```

### 🏆 Reward Algorithm

```
Drop Chance = Base Rate × Wave Multiplier × Rarity Weight

Wave 2: 20% × (Common: 70%, Rare: 30%)
Wave 3: 30% × (Rare: 60%, Epic: 40%)
Wave 4: 50% × (Rare: 40%, Epic: 40%, Legendary: 20%)
Wave 5: 80% × (Epic: 50%, Legendary: 50%)
```
